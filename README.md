# Async Rust Web Scraping Project

This project is a Rust-based web scraping application designed to efficiently fetch, parse, and store data from web pages. It utilizes modern Rust async features, robust error handling, and supports multiple database backends.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Web Scraping**: Fast data retrieval and processing using `reqwest` and `tokio`.
- **HTML Parsing**: Extract data seamlessly using the `scraper` library.
- **Flexible Data Storage**: Supports SQLite, PostgreSQL, and Redis.
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting to respect website request policies.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management to handle network and parsing errors gracefully.
- **Deployment Ready**: Containerized setup for easy deployment.
- **Monitoring**: Integrated logging and monitoring setup.
